Shopping List tool written in PHP - can be easily accessed by smartphone when you're at the shops!

the file here called "thelist" is also accessed by the RFID front door script in the other repo - I included a copy of it there, but these are both the same file and should be placed somewhere where both this app and the rfdo.sh script can access it
